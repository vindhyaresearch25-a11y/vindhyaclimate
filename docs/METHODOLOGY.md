# Methodology — MP Climate Intelligence System

## 1. Study area and scope

Madhya Pradesh, India. Five focus districts that span the state's climatic and agro-ecological diversity:

| District  | Centroid (lat, lon)   | Climate setting                       |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Bhopal    | 23.260°N, 77.413°E    | Malwa plateau, central MP             |
| Indore    | 22.720°N, 75.858°E    | Western Malwa, semi-arid edge         |
| Jabalpur  | 23.181°N, 79.986°E    | Narmada basin, central                |
| Rewa      | 24.531°N, 81.297°E    | Vindhya/Baghelkhand, northeastern     |
| Sidhi     | 24.418°N, 81.881°E    | Sidhi-Singrauli belt, eastern MP      |

Historical analysis window: 2000–2024 (25 years). Future projection: 10-year window 2036–2045 centred on 2040.

## 2. Data sources

### 2.1 Historical observations — IMD 0.05° gridded NetCDF

- **Daily Tmax, Tmin (°C)** — IMD INDmet product, 0.05° × 0.05° (~5.5 km × 5.5 km)
- **Daily Rainfall (mm)** — same grid
- Yearly files, 2000–2024 inclusive
- Variables auto-detected from common name aliases (tmax/TMAX/temperature, etc.)
- Missing values (-999) masked out before any computation

### 2.2 Future projections — CMIP6 via Google Earth Engine

- Dataset: `NASA/GDDP-CMIP6` (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6: bias-corrected statistically downscaled daily data, 0.25° ≈ 25 km)
- Models (8): ACCESS-CM2, CMCC-ESM2, EC-Earth3, GFDL-ESM4, INM-CM5-0, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-MM
- Scenario: SSP2-4.5 (middle-of-the-road emissions)
- Future window: 2036–2045 (centred on 2040)
- Baseline within same dataset: 2000–2014 (historical experiment)
- Reported value = ensemble mean; **headline metric is the delta** (future − baseline) since absolute model output carries residual bias

### 2.3 Vegetation — MODIS via GEE

- `MODIS/061/MOD13Q1` NDVI, 250 m, 16-day composite, 2018–2024 mean
- Scaled by 0.0001 to dimensionless NDVI

## 3. Sampling strategy

For each district, the daily IMD raster is spatially averaged over a **±0.1° bounding box** around the centroid. That covers approximately a 5×5 pixel block (≈ 11 km × 11 km). This avoids the noise of single-pixel sampling while keeping the value representative of the district's geographic core.

## 4. Index definitions

### 4.1 Heatwave (IMD plains definition)

A day at station/grid is a heatwave day when **either**:

1. Tmax ≥ 40°C **and** Tmax − climatological_normal ≥ 4.5°C, **or**
2. Tmax ≥ 45°C (absolute threshold)

Severe heatwave: departure ≥ 6.5°C **or** Tmax ≥ 47°C.

A heatwave **event** requires ≥ 2 consecutive days meeting the criteria. Restricted to March–June (Indian heatwave season). The climatological normal is the smoothed (15-day rolling) mean of Tmax for each day-of-year across 2000–2024.

Reported per year per district:
- `heatwave_days` — total heatwave days during runs ≥ 2 consecutive
- `severe_heatwave_days`
- `max_summer_tmax`, `mean_summer_tmax`

### 4.2 Drought — Standardized Precipitation Index (McKee et al., 1993)

Monthly precipitation totals are fitted to a gamma distribution per calendar month using `scipy.stats.gamma.fit(positive_values, floc=0)`. Zero-precipitation months are handled with the mixed-distribution correction:

$$ H(x) = q + (1-q) \cdot G(x) $$

where q = fraction of zero months and G is the gamma CDF for positive values. SPI is then computed as the inverse standard normal CDF of H(x).

SPI is computed at three time scales: **3, 6, 12 months**.

Drought thresholds:
- SPI ≤ -1.0 → moderate drought (used for `drought_months/year`)
- SPI ≤ -1.5 → severe drought (`severe_drought_months/year`)

`drought_probability_pct` = % of months in the full record with SPI-3 ≤ -1.0.

### 4.3 Extreme Precipitation (ETCCDI indices)

Reference: Karl et al. (1999), Zhang et al. (2011). Computed per year:

| Index   | Definition                                                            |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R95p    | Annual sum of rainfall on days exceeding the 95th percentile of wet-day rainfall in the reference period |
| R99p    | Same but 99th percentile                                              |
| Rx1day  | Maximum daily precipitation in the year                               |
| Rx5day  | Maximum 5-day cumulative precipitation                                |
| CDD     | Maximum consecutive dry-day spell (rainfall < 1 mm)                   |
| CWD     | Maximum consecutive wet-day spell (rainfall ≥ 1 mm)                   |
| ETD     | Count of days exceeding 95th percentile                               |

Wet-day threshold: 1 mm. Percentile thresholds are computed from the full 2000–2024 wet-day series, then applied per year.

## 5. Future projection methodology

For each model in the ensemble:
- Filter the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 collection by `(model, scenario, date_range)`
- Convert `tasmax` from Kelvin to °C, `pr` from kg/m²/s to mm/day
- Compute the same family of indices (heatwave days, max Tmax, R95p, Rx1day, annual rainfall)
- Average across all 8 models → ensemble mean

For each district we compute three numbers per index:
1. `future` — ensemble mean over 2036–2045
2. `baseline` — ensemble mean over 2000–2014 (historical experiment)
3. `delta = future − baseline`

The **delta is the meaningful number** for impact assessment because most CMIP6 model systematic bias survives downscaling and is largely subtracted out when you compare future to historical from the same model.

## 6. Risk classification (composite)

Each district's overall risk band (`low / moderate / high / extreme`) is a simple ordinal sum:

| Component                            | Threshold | Score |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| `drought_probability_pct`            | ≥ 60      | +2    |
| `drought_probability_pct`            | ≥ 40      | +1    |
| `heatwave_days_mean`                 | ≥ 12      | +2    |
| `heatwave_days_mean`                 | ≥ 6       | +1    |
| `severe_drought_months_mean`         | ≥ 2       | +1    |

Total ≥ 4 → extreme, ≥ 3 → high, ≥ 1 → moderate, else low.

This is intentionally simple and replaceable. A production system would calibrate weights against historical impact data (crop loss, mortality, declared drought years).

## 7. Limitations

1. **Spatial granularity.** The IMD 0.05° grid is ≈ 5.5 km; most villages in MP are smaller than one pixel. "Village-level" outputs in this dashboard are technically pixel-level outputs labelled at the nearest village/district. This should be stated explicitly in any operational deployment.
2. **Record length.** 25 years is shorter than the WMO climate normal (30 years). The gamma fits behind SPI are noisier at the tails, and percentile thresholds for extreme precipitation have wider uncertainty bands than they would with 30+ years.
3. **Single CMIP6 scenario.** Only SSP2-4.5 is used. Operational climate-services should report at minimum SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 with uncertainty.
4. **Ensemble size.** 8 models is the minimum defensible ensemble. CMIP6 has 40+; production work would use the full ensemble with weighting.
5. **No bias correction beyond what NEX-GDDP applies.** Quantile mapping on top would improve realism. Reporting delta-from-baseline mostly avoids this concern.
6. **No downscaling to village resolution.** The IMD grid is already as fine as we get from a public observation product. Stochastic downscaling would only smooth and add fake precision.
7. **Heatwave climatology is fitted on the same period as the analysis.** This is unavoidable with 25 years of data but means "departure from normal" is a within-sample statistic.
